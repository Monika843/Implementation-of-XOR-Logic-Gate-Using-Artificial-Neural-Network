# Implementation-of-XOR-Logic-Gate-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project focuses on implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras to solve the XOR (Exclusive OR) logical problem. The XOR problem is a fundamental example in machine learning that demonstrates the limitations of single-layer perceptrons and the importance of hidden layers in neural networks.
This project demonstrates how an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can solve the classic XOR (Exclusive OR) logical problem using TensorFlow and Keras.

The XOR problem is a well-known example in machine learning that cannot be solved using a single-layer perceptron because it is not linearly separable. This project shows how adding a hidden layer enables the neural network to learn nonlinear patterns.Input Layer: 2 neurons

Hidden Layer: 2 neurons (ReLU activation)

Output Layer: 1 neuron (Sigmoid activation)
