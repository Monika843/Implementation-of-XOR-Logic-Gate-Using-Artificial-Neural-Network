# Implementation-of-XOR-Logic-Gate-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project focuses on implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras to solve the XOR (Exclusive OR) logical problem. The XOR problem is a fundamental example in machine learning that demonstrates the limitations of single-layer perceptrons and the importance of hidden layers in neural networks.
